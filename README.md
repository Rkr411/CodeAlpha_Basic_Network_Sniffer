**Task 1: Cyber Security remote internship @ CodeAlpha**

This Python code implements a basic network sniffer using the Scapy library. It allows you to:

             1. Listing: It helps you see the network interfaces your computer has.
             2. Capturing: You can choose an interface and tell the program how many packets to capture from that interface.
             3. Displaying: Once captured, the program shows detailed information about each packet, including the type of communication (e.g., TCP, UDP) and the data being sent.
